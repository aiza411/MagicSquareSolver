# Magic Square Solver

The magic square is a square matrix, whose order is odd and where the sum of the elements for each row or each column or each diagonal is same. The sum of each row or each column or each diagonal can be found using this formula: 
                                ### n(n2+ 1)/2.

It is played on a 3×3 table containing each of the numbers 1 to 9. The number 9 is the “movable number”. You can move 9 in four directions (up/down/left/right), and swap 9 with the number in that direction. The initial state is shown in Table 1. As the player, we want to move 9 to reach a final state such that the sum of the three numbers on every row, column, and diagonal is 15. There are multiple states that satisfy this condition, and you can stop your answer when you find the first satisfied state.
